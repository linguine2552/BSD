   MAIN BINDINGS [ranger]
     h, j, k, l    Move left, down, up or right

     ^D or J, ^U or K
                   Move a half page down, up

     H, L          Move back and forward in the history

     gg            Move to the top

     G             Move to the bottom

     [, ]          Move up and down in the parent directory.

     ^R            Reload everything

     F             Toggle freeze_files setting.  When active (indicated by a
                   cyan FROZEN message in the status bar), directories and
                   files will not be loaded, improving performance when all
                   the files you need are already loaded.  This does not
                   affect file previews, which can be toggled with zI.  Also
                   try disabling the preview of directories with zP.

     ^L            Redraw the screen

     i             Inspect the current file in a bigger window.

     E             Edit the current file in $VISUAL otherwise $EDITOR
                   otherwise "vim"

     S             Open a shell in the current directory

     ?             Opens this man page

     W             Opens the log window where you can review messages that pop
                   up at the bottom.

     w             Opens the task window where you can view and modify
                   background processes that currently run in ranger.  In
                   there, you can type "dd" to abort a process and "J" or "K"
                   to change the priority of a process.  Only one process is
                   run at a time.

     yy            Copy (yank) the selection, like pressing Ctrl+C in modern
                   GUI programs.  (You can also type "ya" to add files to the
                   copy buffer, "yr" to remove files again, or "yt" for
                   toggling.)

     dd            Cut the selection, like pressing Ctrl+X in modern GUI
                   programs.  (There are also "da", "dr" and "dt" shortcuts
                   equivalent to "ya", "yr" and "yt".)

     pp            Paste the files which were previously copied or cut, like
                   pressing Ctrl+V in modern GUI programs.

                   Conflicts will be renamed by appending an '_' (and a
                   counter if necessary), resulting in "file.ext_",
                   "file.ext_0", etc. If you prefer "file_.ext" you can use
                   the "paste_ext" command.

     po            Paste the copied/cut files, overwriting existing files.
